The files in this repositiory should have all of the peices to run them. 
Files fall under a couple of different types, which perhaps isn't obvious within the file names.
Folders all contain their own README.

25PairsText, 49PairsText, 49Glues[L,c,le,re].txt are text files containing the base cases talked about in our paper, both base 'nice' pairs and glues

regPairs.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook running on a Sagemath Kernel used to find base pairs

GerbiczProof.py is a python program that uses small.py, glues.py, and baseCases.py as imputs to find large Hamiltonian cycles using the algorithim outlined in Robert Gerbicz's proof
      small.py, glues.py, and baseCases.py are copies from Roberts original code, formated to work with our Python code

'A New Result on Parkers Square Sum Conjecture' is a PDF of the write up of a previous group of students research on this topic 

'The Square-Sum Problem Forum' is a PDF of the original forum thread where Robert Gerbicz and others posted their work. Since we started working on this project the forum thread has been altered so you can only access it on the original website if you have an account. Thus, we have included a PDF here if one wants to read the forum without making an account.
