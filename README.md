The files in this repositiory should have all of the peices to run them. 
Files fall under a couple of different types, which perhaps isn't obvious within the file names.
Folders all contain their own README.

'Reference Links' is a PDF of links to other people's work which could be helpful when you are begining to think about this problem. After the link, there is also a brief discription of what they are and why we think they are useful. 

'Proofs_of_Parker's_Square_Sum_Conjecture.pdf' is a PDF of our final paper after our 8 weeks of summer research. If you are interested in exploring our work in paritular, this is a good first choice of things to look at. 

'Proofs_of_Parker's_Square_Sum_Conjecture_LaTeX.zip' is the LaTeX code that we used to compile our final paper. This can be referenced if you are curious how we managed to TeX specific elements of our paper. 

25PairsText, 49PairsText, 49Glues[L,c,le,re].txt are text files containing the base cases talked about in our paper, both base 'nice' pairs and glues

regPairs.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook running on a Sagemath Kernel used to find base pairs

hexGraph.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook running on a Sagemath Kernel that graphs 

GerbiczProof.py is a python program that uses small.py, glues.py, and baseCases.py as imputs to find large Hamiltonian cycles using the algorithim outlined in Robert Gerbicz's proof
      small.py, glues.py, and baseCases.py are copies from Roberts original code, formated to work with our Python code

'A New Result on Parkers Square Sum Conjecture' is a PDF of the write up of a previous group of students research on this topic 

'The Square-Sum Problem Forum' is a PDF of the original forum thread where Robert Gerbicz and others posted their work. Since we started working on this project the forum thread has been altered so you can only access it on the original website if you have an account. Thus, we have included a PDF here if one wants to read the forum without making an account.
