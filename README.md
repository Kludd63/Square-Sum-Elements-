The files in this repositiory should have all of the peices to run them. 
Files fall under a couple of different types, which perhaps isn't obvious within the file names.

25PairsText, 49PairsText, 49Glues[L,c,le,re].txt are text files containing the base cases talked about in our paper, both base 'nice' pairs and glues

regPairs.ipynb is a Jupyter notebook running on a Sagemath Kernel used to find base pairs

GerbiczProof.py is a python program that uses small.py, glues.py, and baseCases.py as imputs to find large Hamiltonian cycles using the algorithim outlined in Robert Gerbicz's proof
